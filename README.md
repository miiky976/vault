# Vault
This is the "core" of a vault functionality.
I am planning to make it modular, to be able to do more stuff.

One of them is a TUI, 
And even a self hosted bitwarden bootleg clone.

I want to make it portable, so im gonna use SQLite.
But with `Turso`, and as I know it can be stored in the cloud .-.

## TODO

### Must

- [ ] Password generator.
- [ ] Password based encryption/decryption.
- [ ] SQLite storage.

### Wish

- [ ] OTP code generator.
- [ ] Phrase password generator (It can't be that hard, right?).
